# Brainstorm Command

You MUST use this before any creative work.

Delegate to `superpowers:brainstormer` agent to facilitate the design process:

1. Understand current project context
2. Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
3. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
4. Present design in sections for validation
5. Document the validated design

**Usage:** `/brainstorm [optional topic]`

If a topic is provided, start brainstorming that topic. Otherwise, ask what we're designing.
